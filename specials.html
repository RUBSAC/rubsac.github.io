                        Research and Diver Development, a marine field station that serves as a platform for researchers
                        in the False Bay area of Cape Town, South Africa.

                        Mike is a marine biologist and conservationist and a PADI master scuba diver instructor. He has
                        travelled the world diving and experiencing many ecosystems and their inhabitants. His main
                        interests lie in the field of inter-specific animal behaviour and he has worked on shark
                        deterrents using killer whale stimuli.

                    <p>
                        Mike will be talking about the application of SCUBA diving and field skills as a marine
                        biologists or conservationist. He will also be explaining a little about Cape RADD, what they
                        do, as well as talking about the area in Cape Town and their study site.

                        Reading University BSAC are super excited to invite you to a webinar, by professional diver,
                        professional biologist <br /> and author of 'Sex, Drugs and Scuba Diving', Dr. Klaus M. Stiefel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Klaus will be talking about one of our most favourite fish in all the oceans - the consistently
                        overlooked Shrimp Goby!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you've ever dived in the tropics, chances are you'll have passed by some of these dudes.
                        These fascinating critters live in a symbiotic partnership with their shrimp buddy, looking out
                        for one another and generally being an excellent role model for us all. And they are absolutely
                        fascinating to watch (if you've the patience to wait for them to come out of hiding!).
                    </p>
