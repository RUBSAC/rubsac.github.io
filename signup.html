                    <p>
                        You will need to register by completing <a href="https://forms.gle/mfaVHsVc9P9tNco4A" target="_blank">this
                            form</a>.

                    <p>
                        Once you have filled out the form, each week you will be sent an invite for the webinars you
                        have chosen (e.g. Dive Leader sessions). You only need to fill out the form once, unless you
                        would like to sign up for more!

                    <h2>How the sessions work...</h2>
                    <p>
                        The webinar will be hosted on the University of Reading’s Microsoft Teams software. Don’t
                        worry! You won’t need to install anything. You simply follow the link in the email which will
                        open up in a web browser (you will need either Microsoft Edge, or Google Chrome – Safari does
                        <b>not</b> work).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you follow the link, you should see the following message. If you don’t have Teams
                        installed, we recommend you join on the web. Click the button <b>shown</b>:
                    </p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <p>
                        Your browser might ask if Teams can use your camera and microphone. Click <b>Allow</b> – don’t
                        worry, you can turn them off whenever you like. Turning this on will allow you to ask questions
                        using your microphone during intervals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You should then be taken to a page which looks like below. Please <b>enter your name</b>, and
                        turn off
                        your <b>webcam</b> and <b>microphone</b>. This is very important! You should keep your camera
                        and microphone
                        muted throughout the session. Click ‘Join Now’.

                        Make sure you still have your <b>webcam</b> and <b>microphone</b> muted. You can also click on
                        the <b>Meeting Chat</b> button to enable text chat. You can use this to ask questions
                        throughout the session. The presenter may answer during the lecture, or one of our instructor
                        team may respond in the Meeting Chat.
