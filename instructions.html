                        Sign up on <a href="signup.html">this page</a> for the lectures you want to do.
                        For SDCs you need to sign up for each lecture individually, but for Ocean Diver,
                        Sports Diver, or Dive Leader you only need to sign up once per course.

                        There are lots of ways to join us, but the most reliable method is to use a
                        ‘proper’ computer or laptop, and log into Teams in Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.
                        Safari does <b>not</b> work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is possible to join using your mobile phone or tablet (e.g. iPad), but be aware that you may
                        be missing the chat functionality and you may not be able to participate in any of the
                        interactive parts of the session. Again, if using an iPad please make sure you have a browser
                        other than Safari.

                        Don’t worry, you won’t need to install anything! The webinar will be hosted on the University
                        of Reading’s Microsoft Teams software. You simply follow the link in the email which will open
                        up in a web browser.

                        worry, you can turn them off whenever you like. Turning this on will allow you to ask questions
                        using your microphone during intervals.

                        participants cannot be accepted into the room.

                        click on the <b>Meeting Chat</b> button to enable text chat. You can use this to ask questions
                        throughout the session. The presenter may answer during the lecture, or one of our instructor
                        team may respond in the Meeting Chat.

                            Make sure your speakers/headphones are plugged in/turned on. Make sure your system

                            We are also aware of issues using Apple’s Safari browser. If you use it, you won’t be
                            able to hear! Install Google Chrome instead or, if all else fails, install the
                            Microsoft Teams app. Both are available for free!

                            Did you select the Phone audio option (below) when you entered the room? If so, you
                            won’t hear anything! Close the window and re-enter without this selected.

                            If the chat button is not live or it's saying you're not a member of the team, this
                            can usually be resolved by leaving and re-joining the session. If you're viewing us
                            using a browser, this can be achieved by closing the browser and logging in again.
