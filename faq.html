                <h3>How do I record the sessions I've attended?</h3>
                <p>
                    At the end of each lecture we give out a link to a Google form where we
                    ask for your name, email address and club. Once that's done, the next page
                    gives you an instructor number to enter in your log book along with a code
                    that BSAC HQ assures us will be recognised across the UK.

                <p>
                    Of course! We welcome all divers to attend and refresh their knowledge,
                    or even just see how BSAC does things. If you're thinking of crossing
                    over, there's a handy chart <a href="https://www.bsac.com/already-a-diver/equivalent-bsac-qualifications/"
