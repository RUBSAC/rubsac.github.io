                    <h3>I'm not a BSAC diver/member. Can I still attend?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Of course! We welcome all divers to attend and refresh their knowledge, or even just see how we
                        do things at RUBSAC. If you're thinking of crossing over from another agency, there's a handy
                        chart <a href="https://www.bsac.com/already-a-diver/equivalent-bsac-qualifications/" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    <p>
                        Of course! We welcome all divers to attend, further or refresh their knowledge. However,
                        depending on your exact circumstances you may not be able to get credit for attendance as part
                        of the course if you aren’t a paid up member with BSAC and/or your local club. Get in touch
                        with your local club’s Diving Officer or Training Officer for more clarity on their policy.

                    <p>
                        Absolutely! We welcome all divers to attend and further their knowledge. However, depending on
                        your exact circumstances you may not be able to get credit for attendance as part of the course.
                        BSAC encourages progressive learning, and each lecture builds on knowledge you will have picked
                        up in prior lectures/qualifications. You may find concepts difficult to understand or downright
                        confusing if you have skipped something. Sometimes you will not be permitted to get signed off
                        for a lecture until you have completed a pre-requisite. Get in touch with your local club’s
                        Diving Officer or Training Officer for more clarity on what lectures you ought to be taking
                        part in, based on your current level of study.

                    <h3>How do I get signed off in my logbook for the sessions I've attended?</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the end of each lecture we give out a link to a form. <b>This needs to be filled out
                            straight away</b> – it is locked out a couple of hours after the lecture completes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will be asked to fill out your name, email address and your club. Once you have submitted
                        this information, the next page gives you an instructor number to enter in your log book along
                        with a code which you need to put into the signature panel for that lecture. We have confirmed
                        with BSAC HQ that its ok to do this, and their answer is that in the short term this is fine.
                        They are looking into more secure methods of doing this and hope to have a system in place very
                        soon.

                    <h3>Can we get a recording of the lecture please?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sorry no – there are a few good reasons why;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, BSAC does not currently support teaching using videos as an alternative to the
                        interactive lectures (unlike say, PADI or SSI, who rely on a combination of videos and
                        seminars). This is not to say PADI or SSI are wrong. Merely that here at BSAC, we place a lot
                        of value on the interactive nature of our teaching sessions. If you don’t have that experience,
                        some of that value is lost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Secondly, there are data protection issues with us distributing a recording which includes
                        attendees’ interactions without their express permission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thirdly, the presenter does not necessarily consent to their lecture being recorded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sorry about that!
                    </p>

                    <a name="q6"></a>
                    <h3>I forgot to fill out the form, can I still get credit for the lecture in my logbook?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Probably not – we are at pains to explain about the form in the lecture, and it is our only
                        real way of ascertaining if someone took part. There are other ways, but they are very
                        laborious and we simply don’t have time to go digging through dozens of pages of computer
                        records to find out who was and wasn’t here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sorry about that!
